# Pest-and-disease-detection
Created a ML code for detecting the pest in the field. 
Dataset includes 7 pests. 
AlexNet model is used to classify seven types of pests from images, extracting features through convolutional layers and using fully connected layers for classification. 
The model is trained on a dataset of pest images, employing convolutional layers to extract features to classify the pests accurately
